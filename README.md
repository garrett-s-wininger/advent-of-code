# Advent of Code

This repository contains the source code as written for my attempts of the 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge which is held annually.
The source directory structure is split into a few levels. First, we have the
various programming languages in which I have attempted solutions. Second, we
have the particular years that the solutions were attempted. Finally, we have
the actual solution folders for individual day attempts. The structure was
chosen in an attempt to make it easiest to look at languages of interest, rather
than solutions for specific years.

A rough diagram of the structure is below:

```
Programming Languages
\_Years
  \_Days
    \_Source
