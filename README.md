# Advent of Code - 2022

This repository contains the source code as written for my attempt of the Advent 
of Code challenge for 2022. The days are located within language-specific folders
and then either split into individual files or additional subfolders depending on 
the particular build system used for the language. In either case, a README at an 
appropriate folder level will be present to instruct users on how to build and run 
the provided solution.
